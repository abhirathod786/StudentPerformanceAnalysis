EVALUATION & INSIGHTS REPORT
============================================================

PERFORMANCE METRICS:
------------------------------------------------------------
Accuracy:  0.8950 (89.50%)
Precision: 0.8950
Recall:    1.0000
F1-Score:  0.9446
ROC AUC:   0.7005
------------------------------------------------------------

KEY INSIGHTS:
============================================================
1. MODEL PERFORMANCE
   The model achieves 89.5% accuracy in predicting student performance.
   With an AUC of 0.700, the model demonstrates strong discriminative ability.

2. TEST PREPARATION IMPACT
   Students who completed test prep score 7.6 points higher on average.
   Recommendation: Encourage all students to enroll in test preparation courses.

3. OVERALL PERFORMANCE
   Current pass rate: 89.7%
   103 students are at risk of failing.
   Early intervention could help these students improve.

4. SOCIOECONOMIC FACTORS
   Students with parents having 'master's degree' score 10.5 points higher
   than those with parents having 'high school'.
   Recommendation: Provide additional support to students from lower-education backgrounds.

5. SUBJECT ANALYSIS
   Weakest subject: Math (avg: 66.1)
   Recommendation: Focus additional resources on Math instruction.


ACTIONABLE RECOMMENDATIONS:
============================================================

IMMEDIATE ACTIONS:
1. Identify at-risk students using the prediction model
2. Enroll all students in test preparation courses
3. Provide extra tutoring for the weakest subject areas

DATA-DRIVEN STRATEGIES:
4. Track attendance and engagement metrics closely
5. Monitor students from lower socioeconomic backgrounds
6. Implement early warning systems (Week 4-5 of semester)

SUPPORT PROGRAMS:
7. Create peer mentoring programs
8. Offer additional support for economically disadvantaged students
9. Engage parents in the learning process

CONTINUOUS IMPROVEMENT:
10. Regularly update the model with new data
11. Measure effectiveness of interventions
12. Adjust strategies based on results
